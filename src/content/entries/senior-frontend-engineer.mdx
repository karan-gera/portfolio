## Role & Responsibilities

As Senior Frontend Engineer at Streamline Analytics, I was responsible for architecting and implementing the user-facing components of our data visualization platform. This included everything from complex interactive charts to responsive dashboard layouts that needed to perform well with large datasets.

### Technical Leadership

I led the frontend architecture decisions for a platform that processes millions of data points daily. Key responsibilities included:

- **Component Architecture**: Designed a scalable React component library used across 15+ product areas
- **Performance Optimization**: Implemented virtual scrolling and smart memoization strategies for handling large datasets
- **Developer Experience**: Established testing standards and CI/CD pipelines that reduced deployment time by 50%

## Key Achievements

### Performance Optimization
One of my biggest contributions was a comprehensive performance overhaul that improved our Core Web Vitals scores across the board. This involved implementing code splitting, optimizing our bundle size, and creating efficient data loading patterns.

### Mentorship & Team Growth
I mentored three junior developers, helping them grow into confident mid-level engineers. This included regular code reviews, pair programming sessions, and creating internal documentation and training materials.

### Cross-functional Collaboration
Worked closely with the data engineering team to design efficient APIs and with the design team to create a cohesive design system that scaled across multiple product verticals.

## Technical Highlights

The most technically challenging aspect was creating performant data visualizations that could handle real-time updates while maintaining smooth interactions. We achieved this through a combination of D3.js for complex visualizations and React's concurrent features for optimal rendering performance.
